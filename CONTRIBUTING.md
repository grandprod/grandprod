# Contributing to Grandprod

Welcome, and thanks for taking a peek at this project and guide. I'd love to have more help from the community to make this game better for players. There's always a lot to do, and I'm only one person.

## Issues

Issue contribution is always welcome for _well-specced_ issues. Please reach out on Discord before opening an issue if you're not sure about it. For game ideas, please ask before opening or writing up an issue as it will not be accepted if it doesn't fit the vision of the game.

## Pull Requests

I always love pull requests! Please feel free to send PRs that _address specific issues in the tracker_. PRs that don't line up with an existing issue may or may not be closed. Please feel free to reach out to me directly if you want to work on something that isn't currently tracked.

This project is very strict about PRs:

- All PRs must be associated with an issue in the tracker (unless previously agreed upon).
- PR summaries _must not be AI generated_ (I do not want to read text an AI wrote - please write the couple of sentences needed by yourself)
- PRs should include tests for any new functionality or bug fixes.
- PRs must adhere to the project's coding standards and style guide (this is checked by the linter).
- PRs that do not meet these criteria may be closed without review.

Thank you for your understanding and cooperation!

## Content

I'm always interested in receiving new content for the game. There are plenty of ways an idea person could introduce new features, items, or mechanics. If you have an idea, please feel free to share it! I'm more than happy to onboard new contributors and help them get things into the game.

## Art

I would love art updates! I don't want AI generated art, and will eventually want to have a whole set of custom art for the game. Reach out if you're interested in pairing on this.

## Note About Contributions

Please understand that _eventually_ I would like to put this project in a digital storefront. Contributing to this game is accepting that you're doing so willingly, knowing that intent, and are doing so freely.
